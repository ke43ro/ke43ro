- 👋 Hi, I’m @ke43ro
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general. On this site, I have several projects written in Visual Basic one of which uses SQL Server to hold its data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning management of a Google Workspace domain.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 You can reach me at keithr.computing@gmail.com.
